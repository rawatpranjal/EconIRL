# Replications

This page reports numerical replication evidence. A study counts as a paper
replication only when the published design, sample, and estimand are available and
the reported quantities are directly comparable. Each section sets the package
value against the paper's published value, side by side.

## Rust (1987), Table IX, Group 4 (NFXP)

The nested fixed point recovers the bus-engine maintenance and replacement costs
from the original STORDAT Group-4 panel, by full-likelihood BHHH. The package
matches the published Table IX numbers to four or more significant figures, on both
the point estimates and the standard errors.

### beta = 0.9999 (forward-looking)

| Quantity | Package | Paper |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| theta_1 (maintenance) | 2.2931 | 2.2930 |
| theta_1 standard error | 0.6388 | 0.639 |
| RC (replacement) | 10.0750 | 10.0750 |
| RC standard error | 1.5816 | 1.582 |
| p0 transition | 0.3919 | 0.3919 |
| p1 transition | 0.5953 | 0.5953 |
| full log-likelihood | -3304.1548 | -3304.155 |

### beta = 0 (myopic)

| Quantity | Package | Paper |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| theta_1 (maintenance) | 71.5134 | 71.5133 |
| theta_1 standard error | 13.7785 | 13.778 |
| RC (replacement) | 7.6358 | 7.6358 |
| RC standard error | 0.7197 | 0.7197 |
| p0 transition | 0.3919 | 0.3919 |
| p1 transition | 0.5953 | 0.5953 |
| full log-likelihood | -3306.0291 | -3306.028 |

The transition probabilities and their log-likelihood are estimated separately
from the cost parameters, so they are the same across both rows. The replication
runs through `make rust-table-ix`, which fetches the official NFXP data.

## MPEC (Su and Judd, 2012)

Su and Judd prove that their constrained-optimization estimator and the nested
fixed point solve the same maximum-likelihood problem and return the same
estimates (their Proposition 1). The paper's own evidence is a Monte Carlo on the
simulated bus model, with no real-data estimate table. The replication target is
the equivalence: on the bus-engine data, MPEC recovers the NFXP estimates, and so
the published Rust Table IX numbers.

### STORDAT Group-4 panel, beta = 0.9999

| Quantity | MPEC | NFXP | Paper |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| theta_1 (maintenance) | 2.2931 | 2.2931 | 2.2930 |
| theta_1 standard error | 0.6383 | 0.6388 | 0.639 |
| RC (replacement) | 10.0750 | 10.0750 | 10.0750 |
| RC standard error | 1.5815 | 1.5816 | 1.582 |
| choice log-likelihood | -163.5843 | -163.5843 | -163.584 |

The point estimates agree to four or more figures, and the standard errors match
to the precision Rust reports.

### Bundled bus panel, a second discretization

The packaged bus panel bins the same GMC records differently (4329 rows,
transition split 0.3938 / 0.5933 against the STORDAT 0.3919 / 0.5953), which moves
the cost level away from the published table. MPEC still tracks NFXP, which is the
content of Proposition 1.

| beta | Quantity | MPEC | NFXP |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0.9999 | theta_1 | 2.2638 | 2.2636 |
| 0.9999 | RC | 10.1430 | 10.1423 |
| 0.9999 | choice log-likelihood | -163.7111 | -163.7111 |
| 0.975 | theta_1 | 3.7768 | 3.7764 |
| 0.975 | RC | 9.0533 | 9.0529 |
| 0.975 | choice log-likelihood | -164.0198 | -164.0198 |

The cost level differs from the published table because this panel uses a
different binning. The agreement between MPEC and NFXP does not.

## MCE-IRL (Ziebart et al., 2008 and 2010)

Ziebart's reward is a function of state, R(s) linear in state features, on a
deterministic MDP. The paper models Pittsburgh as a deterministic road network
and scores road segments by their features. The published route-choice table
needs the original taxi trajectories, which are not public, so this is a
controlled gridworld recovery, not a paper-number match.

The test is a deterministic 12x12 gridworld. An agent walks from a corner to an
absorbing goal under a state reward over two features, distance to the goal and
distance to the center. Two estimators recover that reward from demonstrations:
maximum causal entropy (MCE-IRL) and its neural-reward form (Neural MCE-IRL, a
multi-layer network over state coordinates).

| Estimator | Reward recovery R² | Policy KL |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MCE-IRL (linear) | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| Neural MCE-IRL | 0.988 | 0.014 |

Mean over three seeds. Reward recovery is the R² of the recovered reward against
the true reward across states, where 1.0 is exact. Only the shape of the reward
across states is identified, not its level. Both estimators recover the reward,
the linear one exactly and the neural one nearly so. The neural reward map does
not cost identification on Ziebart's state-reward problem. This is simulation
evidence, not a replication of a published number.

## CCP / NPL (Hotz-Miller, 1993 and Aguirregabiria-Mira, 2002)

Aguirregabiria and Mira show that iterating the conditional-choice-probability
estimator, nested pseudo-likelihood (NPL), converges to the nested fixed point
estimates. Their Section 5.2 finding is that the one-step Hotz-Miller estimator
is poor, the gains from extra policy iterations come fast, and the K-step NPL
settles to a fixed point. The replication target is this convergence on the
bus-engine data, since the estimator is equivalent to NFXP in theory rather than
a separate published table.

### Bundled bus panel, Group 4, beta = 0.9999

| Estimator | theta_1 | RC | choice log-likelihood |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| NFXP (MLE) | 2.2636 | 10.1423 | -163.7111 |
| Hotz-Miller (K = 1) | 1.2872 | 10.9207 | -168.1879 |
| NPL (K = 5) | 2.2651 | 10.1462 | -163.7113 |
| NPL (K = 20) | 2.2651 | 10.1462 | -163.7113 |

The one-step estimator sits well below the MLE. NPL reaches its fixed point by
the fifth iteration: K = 5 and K = 20 return the same estimates. The fixed point
lands within 0.0002 log-likelihood of the NFXP MLE.

NPL does not attain the MLE here. Its replacement cost differs from NFXP at the
fourth figure, 10.1462 against 10.1423, and its log-likelihood is marginally
lower. The stronger Aguirregabiria-Mira claim, that the NPL and nested fixed
point estimates agree to the twelfth digit, does not reproduce in this
implementation. NFXP remains the exact Rust replication. This is a convergence
reproduction, not a four-figure number match.

## Pending

These estimators have a paper target but no completed replication yet. Each is held
to the same bar: match the published numbers to four or more significant figures, on
both the estimates and the standard errors.
